                Each park features numerous interconnected storylines, ranging
                from simple encounters to complex, epic quests. These stories
                are designed to branch based on the decisions made by guests.
                For example, in Westworld, a simple conversation with a host
                could lead to a series of events that take you on a thrilling
                journey across the frontier.

                Hosts, the lifelike androids that populate the parks, are
                programmed with deep backstories and personalities, allowing for
                rich character interactions. Guests can form relationships with
                these characters, which evolve based on their actions and
                choices. A guest might become the trusted ally of a noble
                samurai in Shogunworld or a feared outlaw in Westworld,
                depending on their decisions.

                The parks are designed to react to the choices made by guests.
                For instance, if a guest decides to rob a bank in Westworld, the
                townâ€™s law enforcement might increase its presence, creating new
                challenges and opportunities for other guests. This dynamic
                environment ensures that no two visits are the same.
