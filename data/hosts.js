Arnold was coninced that hosts will become self-aware some day and couldn't convince Robert to shut down westworld project, so he tasked Dolores to destroy park and hosts. To help the gentle Dolores achieve this task Arnold placed the code of Wyatt, a vicious mass killer to enable her to do it, getting her to enlist the help of Teddy.
